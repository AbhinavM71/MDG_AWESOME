“The soul becomes dyed with the color of its thoughts.” 
Ask the meaning of the color from the color-blind person. Color epitomizes the beautifull landscapes of our planet. Hey folks, I have built an app which has the basic function to differentiate the color by simply changing the gesture of the hand. The color of the screen changes only in uni-direction sense. When the user moves his hand along x-direction, then color changes, while rotating in z-direction color change in two another colors. I had uploaded all files in zip form.
P.S. 

Thank You
